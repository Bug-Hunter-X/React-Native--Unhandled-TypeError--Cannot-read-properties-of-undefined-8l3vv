This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been assigned a value.  This is common in asynchronous operations or when components mount before data is fetched.  The error message might vary slightly depending on the specific context, but you might see something similar to:

```javascript
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')
```

This example shows a common scenario where this happens:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('some-api-endpoint');
      const json = await response.json();
      setData(json);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error happens here if data is not yet populated */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
